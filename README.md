## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS modules
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

If you set your app to 100% viewport width, you can still get horizontal scroll bars.
This is because of the need to fit the vertical scrollbar.
Also need to set max-width to 100%.

### Continued development

I just want to continue to create more complex React apps and become a bit faster at doing it.
